**What is a linked list**

* LinkedList is a data structure that reprensents **a sequence of nodes**. Each node in the single linked list points to its next node. A double linked list also have a pointer to point to its previous node.

* For linked list, when creating it, only one node space is created. This means the spaces is not continuous, and looking up in linked list is **not constant** time.

* For a linked list, you can add and remove a node from the head in constant time. Given a tail node, add after and remove from the tail of a linked list is also **constant** time.
