  2. Think about a stack of dinner plates, the most recently added plate is removed first.
  
* What operations does a stack support?
  1. push(E element), add an element to the top of a stack. **O(1) time**.
  2. peek(), check the top element of a stack. **O(1) time**.
  3. pop(), remove and return the top element of a stack. **O(1) time**.
  4. isEmpty(), check if the stack is empty or not. **O(1) time**.
  5. size(), return the size of a stack. **O(1) time**.
  
* How to implement a stack?

* What can a stack be used to do?
  1. In some cases, it is more favorable to store data in a stack instead of an array.
  2. When there is a need to reverse the elements, think about using **STACK**.
  3. For questions that go through a linear data structure and look back to its nearest neighbors, think about using **STACK**.
